# rock-paper-scizors
This is my first project which is using basic javascript. It's simple rock paper scizors game. User is playing five rounds with computer. He's writing an input "rock, paper, scizors" and then is showing result of his choice by alert and actual stats "e.g 1 to 2". After five rounds it's assumed and showing a winner.
